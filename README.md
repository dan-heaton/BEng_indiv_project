# Undergraduate-Project
This repo contains all files relevant to my final year project ('Detection of Leitmotivs in Wagner's Opera using Neural Networks') 
for BEng Computer Systems Engineering at the University of Birmingham.

Included is the final report .pdf, containing all the details surrounding the project, along with descriptions of the motivations and 
workings of the various files.

Part 1 contains the files created for the preparatory tasks of the project, and as such are not part of the actual project tasks.
Part 2 contains the files used for the complete audio processing, feature extraction, and neural network pipeline within the project.

Please see the .pdf for a complete description of the project
